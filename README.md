Brian McRae Python Learning Project Portfolio
This Git repository includes all relevant Python projects created during my learning path.  I'm new to Python but not new to programming.  Develeped mediocre beginner level programming skills in C++, Visual Basic, and SQL, but this was around the turn of the century.  I found programming to be overly complex, especially with C++, and spent my time chasing semi-colons and memory leaks than I did writing business logic.  Scratching the surface, Python is a breath of fresh air!
